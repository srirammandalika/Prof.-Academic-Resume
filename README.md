## Professional/Academic-Resume

A single-page, one-column resume is the industry standard for most software developer and R&D roles. It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when updating the resume. The different sections are documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. The three main sections in the resume are education, experience, and projects.

### Motivation

I am a final year research focussed B.Tech student specialising in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. I often use an academic CV to apply for research-based jobs and research internships. Academic CVs are often focused on the attention to detail of the candidate and usually contain more than 1 page. On the other side, a Professional Resume is primarily focused on applying to industry-based professional jobs that are often not research-focused. Here, we usually don't mention a few sections like publications, invited talks, references, etc., 

It is highly recommended to keep your professional resume restricted to 1 page, allowing a boost to the ATS score for your resume.
